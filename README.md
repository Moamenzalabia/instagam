The idea of the InstagramDemo application is the same as the idea of Instagram. The user is able to make  a user account and make a post and follow another user. As soon as the follower do following to anohter user, the  follower user shows the second user post's , the second user recieve a notification that tell him this user is following you.  can user open camera and take photo to share it as a post and Saving a picture to a  device ,you can  search about a particular user  to follow him 

what's i used in this app:-

 Firebase authentication, firebase storage, firebase cloud function, firebase notifications, core animation, media library,   user default database, I faceed some problem in push notifications, open media library, fetch user post's
